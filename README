This package contains:
1. bptree.h:      definition of the B-Plus-Tree node.
                  definition of the max number of record in index and leaf node
2. bptree.c:      implementation of the B-Plus-Tree. Mainly for tree init/query/
                  print/record insert/record delete.
3. bpt_utils.c:   utility functions.
4. bptree_test.c: test code.
5. *.log:         test results. B-Plus-Tree printed after each insert/delete.

To run the test code:
  gcc -o bpt bptree.c bptree_test.c
  ./bpt

Currently there are only three testcases:
1. test1(): insert 100 records into the bptree, using 0..99 as the key;
2. test2(): delete the node from the tree created in test1; delete happens from
            99 to 0;
3. test3(): delete the node from the tree created in test1; delete happens from
            0 to 99.

The B-Plus-Tree algorithm is referenced from <<Database System Concept, 6th 
edition>>.
